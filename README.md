## Overview

The **Chess Game** is a Java application that simulates a full chess game through a structured backend system.

Users can play a complete match where all moves are validated according to chess rules, with full game state management and persistence.

This project demonstrates strong understanding of **object-oriented programming, algorithmic logic, and system design.**


---

## Features

- Complete chessboard implementation
- Movement logic for all pieces (King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight, Pawn)
- Rule validation (legal moves, captures, constraints)
- Turn-based gameplay
- Game state saving and loading (.ser)
- Modular and extensible architecture

## Technologies

| Technology | Role |
|------------|------|
| Java| Core programming languagee |
| OOP | System design and abstraction |
| Algorithms | Game logic and rule validation |
| Serialization (.ser) | Game state persistence |
|IntelliJ IDEA | Development environment |

---

## Run Locally


```bash
# Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/anastasia638/java-chess-game.git
cd java-chess-game

# Open in IntelliJ IDEA (or any Java IDE)
# Run the application
Main.java
```

---
## Architecture

| Component| Responsibility |
|------------|------|
| Board| Represents the chessboard and stores game state |
| Piece | Abstract class defining behavior of all pieces |
| Game | Controls turns and overall game flow |
| Move | Validates moves according to chess rules |
|Serialization | Saves and restores game state |

> **Interaction:**

The Game orchestrates the execution of the game by interacting with the Board to update the state, using Move logic to validate actions, and relying on Piece classes to define movement rules.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Object-Oriented Programming:** abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation
- **Algorithms:** rule validation and movement logic
- **Software Design:** modular architecture
- **State Management:** serialization of objects
- **Debugging & Testing:** ensuring consistent game behavior
